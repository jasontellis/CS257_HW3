The testing code works for the file test.txt. We have also incorporated a simple function in test1() called deleteTreeValue(int val) to test BTFileScan. This works too.

The code for BTree file and BTFileScan has been developed by referencing code at 'https://github.com/ajaymandvekar/RDF-minibase-DB/tree/master/src/btree' and adapted to the requirements of the assignment.
